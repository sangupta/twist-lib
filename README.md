## Versioning

For transparency and insight into our release cycle, and for striving 
to maintain backward compatibility, `twist-lib` will be maintained under 
the Semantic Versioning guidelines as much as possible.

Releases will be numbered with the follow format:

```

```

And constructed with the following guidelines:

* Breaking backward compatibility bumps the major
* New additions without breaking backward compatibility bumps the minor
* Bug fixes and misc changes bump the patch
